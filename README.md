## Experience Snapshot
RocketDrop is designed for high-intent product launches where timing and stock matter.

### What it delivers
- Searchable product catalog with server-side filters and sorting
- Time-sensitive drop lifecycle with countdowns
- Queue participation and viewer activity in real time
- Customer flow: auth, cart, addresses, checkout, order tracking

## Drop Engine
The drop system is built to make launch events explicit and trackable.

    UPCOMING --> LIVE: dropTime reached and stock > 0
    LIVE --> SOLD_OUT: stock == 0
    LIVE --> [*]: product retired/delisted

## Configuration and Security

Primary app config file:
- backend/src/main/resources/application.properties

Security model:
- JWT stateless authentication
- Role-based access (CUSTOMER, ADMIN)
- Admin namespace: /api/admin/**
- Public browsing for product/category GET endpoints

Production safety checklist:
- Move all secrets to environment variables
- Rotate exposed credentials before deployment
- Enable managed backups and monitoring

## Deployment Blueprint

Recommended setup:
- Frontend: Vercel or Netlify
- Backend: ECS/Render/Fly/EC2
- Database: Managed MySQL (RDS, PlanetScale, Aiven, etc.)
- Realtime scale-out: Redis pub/sub backplane when running multiple API instances
